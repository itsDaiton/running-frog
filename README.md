## Description

A simple JavaScript application heavily based on the famous mobile game Flappy Bird. The application was developed based on a private contract with a client. The task was to create a simple web game that would serve as a fun tool in a festival that the client was hosting. 

The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible. Points are being added by jumping over incoming mushrooms. The speed of the mushrooms will increase based on the current score.

The game features unique and colorful images and a special soundtrack.
